      This data set consists of a circumpolar map of dominant soil
      characteristics, with a scale of 1:10,000,000, covering the United
      States, Canada, Greenland, Iceland, northern Europe, Russia, Mongolia,
      and Kazakhstan. The map was created using the Northern and Mid Latitude
      Soil Database. The map is in ESRI Shapefile format, consisting of 11
      regional areas.. Polygons have attributes that give the percentage
      polygon area that is a given soil type. The map shows the dominant soil
      of the spatial polygon unless the polygon is over 90 percent rock or ice.
      It also shows the proportion of polygon encompassed by the dominant soil
      or nonsoil. Soils include turbels, orthels, histels, histosols,
      mollisols, vertisols, aridisols, andisols, entisols, spodosols,
      inceptisols (and hapludolls), alfisols (cryalf and udalf), natric great
      groups, aqu-suborders, glaciers, and rocklands. Data are available via

    abstract: 'The Sea Ice Index provides a quick look at Arctic- and Antarctic-wide changes in sea ice. It is a source for consistent, up-to-date sea ice extent and concentration images, in PNG format, and data values, in GeoTIFF and ASCII text files, from November 1978 to the present. Sea Ice Index images also depict trends and anomalies in ice cover calculated using a 30-year reference period of 1981 through 2010.

The images and data are produced in a consistent way that makes the Index time-series appropriate for use when looking at long-term trends in sea ice cover. Both monthly and daily products are available. However, monthly products are better to use for long-term trend analysis because errors in the daily product tend to be averaged out in the monthly product and because day-to-day variations are often the result of short-term weather.'

        identified but the majority of regional populations have shown declines over the
        past three decades. While they are currently abundant, climate change is
        projected to pose problems to murres in the future, especially for the more
        northern species, the thick-billed murre, which is strongly associated with sea
        ice. Other threats include fisheries interactions, over-exploitation,
        contaminants, and oil spills, the latter becoming more important if climate
        change expands shipping and hydrocarbon development in the Arctic.

        Greenland Ecosystem Monitoring (GEM) is an integrated monitoring and
        long-term research programme on ecosystems and climate change effects
        and feedbacks in the Arctic. Since 1995 the programme has established a
        coherent and integrated understanding of the functioning of ecosystems
        in a highly variable climate, which is based upon a comprehensive,
        long-term inter-disciplinary data collection carried out by Danish and
        Greenlandic monitoring and research institutions.

        The GEM Programme put around 75 scientists in the field annually to
        collect data on ecosystem and climate change in Greenland. The data
        base currently covers data from monitoring programmes from Zackenberg
        (1995-), Kobbefjord at Nuuk (2007-) and Disko (2017-). The well over
        1000 parameters are freely available via the GEM Database and used by
        GEM participants and external scientists to produce scientific papers,
        scientific assessments, advisory reports, etc.

      Geothermal heat flux distribution for the Greenland ice sheet, derived by
      combining a global representation and information from deep ice cores
    abstract: >-
      We present a distribution of the geothermal heat flux (GHF) for
      Greenland, which is an update of two earlier versions by Greve (2005,
      Ann. Glaciol. 42) and Greve and Herzfeld (2013, Ann. Glaciol. 54). The
      GHF distribution is constructed in two steps. First, the global
      representation by Pollack et al. (1993, Rev. Geophys. 31) is scaled for
      the area of Greenland. Second, by means of a paleoclimatic simulation
      carried out with the ice sheet model SICOPOLIS, the GHF values for five
      deep ice core locations are modified such that observed and simulated
      basal temperatures match closely. The resulting GHF distribution
      generally features low values in the south and the north-west, whereas
      elevated values prevail in central North Greenland and towards the
      north-east. The data are provided as NetCDF files on two different grids
      (EPSG:3413 grid, Bamber grid) that have frequently been used in modelling
      studies of the Greenland ice sheet, and for the three different
      resolutions of 5 km, 10 km and 20 km.

    title: 'Sentinel-2 Imagery Mosaics'
    abstract: >-
        Each summer, surface melting of the margin of the Greenland Ice Sheet
        exposes a distinctive visible stratigraphy that is related to past
        variability in subaerial dust deposition across the accumulation zone
        and subsequent ice flow toward the margin. Here we map this surface
        stratigraphy along the northern margin of the ice sheet using mosaicked
        Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite imagery from the end of the 2019 melt
        season and finer-resolution WorldView-2/3 imagery for smaller regions of
        interest. We trace three distinct transitions in apparent dust
        concentration and the top of a darker basal layer. The three dust
        transitions have been identified previously as representing
        late-Pleistocene climatic transitions, allowing us to develop a coarse
        margin chronostratigraphy for northern Greenland. Substantial folding of
        late-Pleistocene stratigraphy is observed but uncommon. The oldest
        conformal surface-exposed ice in northern Greenland is likely located
        adjacent to Warming Land and may be up to ~55 thousand years old. Basal
        ice is commonly exposed hundreds of metres from the ice margin and may
        indicate a widespread frozen basal thermal state. We conclude that the
        ice margin across northern Greenland offers multiple opportunities to
        recover paleoclimatically distinct ice relative to previously studied
        regions in southwestern Greenland.

        Countries distinguish between metropolitan (homeland) and independent

        the dependent overseas regions broken out (like in ISO codes, see France
        for example), use map units instead.

        Each country is coded with a world region that roughly follows the
        United Nations setup.

        Countries are coded with standard ISO and FIPS codes. French INSEE codes
        are also included.

        Includes some thematic data from the United Nations (1), U.S. Central

        This atlas consists of a description of data analysis procedures and
        horizontal maps of climatological distribution fields of temperature at
        selected standard depth levels of the World Ocean on one-degree and
        quarter-degree latitude-longitude grids.  The aim of the maps is to
        illustrate large-scale characteristics of the distribution of ocean
        temperature.  The fields used to generate these climatological maps were
        computed by objective analysis of all scientifically quality-controlled
        historical temperature data in the World Ocean Database 2018.  Maps are
        presented for climatological composite periods (annual, seasonal,
        monthly, seasonal and monthly difference fields from the annual mean
        field, and the number of observations) at 102 standard depths.

        Contribution of the Greenland Ice Sheet to sea-level over the next
        millennium using Large Ensemble Simulations, spatial time series,
        2008-3007.
    abstract: >-
        The Greenland Ice Sheet holds around 7.2 meters of sea-level equivalent. In
        recent decades rising atmosphere and ocean temperatures have led to an
        acceleration in mass loss, adding an average of about 0.5 millimeters per
        year to global mean sea-level between 1991 and 2015. Current ice margin
        recession in Greenland is led by the retreat of outlet glaciers, the large
        rivers of ice ending in narrow fjords that drain the ice sheet
        interior. Recent progress in measuring ice thickness is enabling models to
        reproduce the complex flow patterns found in outlet glaciers, a key step
        towards realistic projections. Here we pair an outlet glacier resolving ice
        sheet model with a comprehensive uncertainty quantification to estimate
        Greenland's contribution to sea-level over the next millennium under
        different climate forcings. We find that Greenland could contribute 5-33
        centimeters to sea-level by 2100 and 11-155 centimeters by 2200, with
        discharge from outlet glaciers contributing 6-45% of the total mass
        loss. Our analysis shows that uncertainties in projecting mass loss are
        dominated by uncertainties in climate scenarios and surface processes,
        followed by ice dynamics, whereas uncertainties in ocean conditions play a
        minor role, particularly in the long term. We project that Greenland will
        very likely become ice-free within a millennium without significant
        reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.

        This dataset compilation contains the simulations for the manuscript
        "Contribution of the Greenland Ice Sheet to sea-level over the next
        millennium" prepared with the Parallel Ice Sheet Model (PISM).

        This dataset provides the likelihood of a pixel being ice covered at the
        year 3007 for the RCPs (Representative Concentration Pathways) 2.6, 4.5, and
        8.5 for LES (Large Ensemble Simulations).

    title: 'Muskox status, recent variation, and uncertain future'
    abstract: >-
      Muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus) are an integral component of Arctic
      biodiversity. Given low genetic diversity, their ability to respond to
      future and rapid Arctic change is unknown, although paleontological
      history demonstrates adaptability within limits. We discuss status and
      limitations of current monitoring, and summarize circumpolar status and
      recent variations, delineating all 55 endemic or translocated
      populations. Acknowledging uncertainties, global abundance is ca 170 000
      muskoxen. Not all populations are thriving. Six populations are in
      decline, and as recently as the turn of the century, one of these was the
      largest population in the world, equaling ca 41% of today’s total
      abundance. Climate, diseases, and anthropogenic changes are likely the
      principal drivers of muskox population change and result in multiple
      stressors that vary temporally and spatially. Impacts to muskoxen are
      precipitated by habitat loss/degradation, altered vegetation and species
      associations, pollution, and harvest. Which elements are relevant for a
      specific population will vary, as will their cumulative interactions. Our
      summaries highlight the importance of harmonizing existing data,
      intensifying long-term monitoring efforts including demographics and
      health assessments, standardizing and implementing monitoring protocols,
      and increasing stakeholder engagement/contributions.

      1992-2020 Greenland surface elevation change from ERS-1, ERS-2, ENVISAT,

    abstract: >-
      Data are based on the European Space Agency's Ku-band radar satellite
      level-2 data products.  Given the longer time span of operation of the
      satellites, the data are provided at a five-year mean.

      The algorithms used to derive the product are explained in detail in
      Simonsen and Sørensen (2017), and Sørensen et al. (2018). The approach
      used here is the most optimal combination of the XO-, TR-, and
      PF-algorithm; the data are corrected for both backscatter and
      leading-edge width, and solved at 1 km grid resolution and averaged in
      the post-processing to 5 km grid resolution by ordinary kriging.

    abstract: >-
      During the last decade, the GRACE mission hasprovided valuable data for
      determining the mass changes ofthe Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets.
      Yet, discrepancies still exist in the published mass balance results, and
      comprehensive analyses on the sources of errors and discrepancies are
      lacking. Here, we present monthly mass changes together with trends
      derived from GRACE data at basin scalefor both the Greenland and Antarctic
      ice sheets, and we assess the variability and errors for each of the
      possible sources of discrepancies, and we do this in an unprecedented
      systematic way, taking into account mass inference methods, datasets and
      background models.  We find a very good agreement between the monthly mass
      change results derived from two independent methods, which represents a
      cross validation.  For the monthly solutions, we find that most of the
      scatter is caused by the use of the two different data sets rather than
      the two different methods applied. Besides the well-known GIA trend
      uncertainty, we find that the geocenter motion and the recent dealiasing
      corrections significantly impact the trends, with contributions of+13.2 Gt
      yr−1and−20 Gt yr−1, respectively, for Antarctica, which is more affected
      by these than Greenland.  We show differences between the use of release
      RL04 and the new RL05 and confirma lower noise content in the new
      release. The overall scatter of the solutions well exceeds the
      uncertainties propagated from the data errors and the leakage (as done in
      the past); hence we calculate new sound total errors for the monthly
      solutions and the trends. We find that the scatter in the monthly
      solutions caused by applying different estimates of geocenter motion time
      series(degree-1 corrections) is significant – contributing with up to 40%
      of the total error.

      The product provides modeled mean annual ground temperatures (MAGT) at the
      top of the permafrost for the Northern Hemisphere at 1 km spatial
      resolution. Permafrost probability (fraction values from 0 to 1) is
      assigned to each grid cell with MAGT < 0°C. Based on its permafrost
      probability each grid cell is classified as continuous, discontinuous and
      sporadic permafrost. The processing extent covers exposed land areas of
      the Northern Hemisphere down to 25 ° latitude. The mean MAGT was validated
      with GTN-P and TSP borehole ground temperature data and yielded a RMS of
      2.0 °C. According to the results, permafrost (MAGT < 0 °C) covers 15 % of
      exposed land of the Northern Hemisphere.

      The map was produced within the project ESA Data User Element
      GlobPermafrost.

      Global Land Ice Measurements from Space (GLIMS) is an international
      initiative with the goal of repeatedly surveying the world's estimated
      200,000 glaciers. GLIMS uses data collected by the Advanced Spaceborne
      Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) instrument aboard the
      Terra satellite and the LANDSAT series of satellites, along with
      historical observations.

      The GLIMS initiative has created a unique glacier inventory, storing
      information about the extent and rates of change of all the world's
      mountain glaciers and ice caps. The GLIMS Glacier Database was built up
      from data contributions from many glaciological institutions, which are
      managed by Regional Coordinators, who coordinate the production of glacier
      mapping results for their particular region. The GLIMS Glacier Database
      provides students, educators, scientists, and the public with reliable
      glacier data from these analyses. New glacier data are continually being
      added to the database.

    title: 'The World Magnetic Model'
    abstract: >-
      The World Magnetic Model is a joint product of the United States’ National
      Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) and the United Kingdom’s Defence
      Geographic Centre (DGC). The WMM was developed jointly by the National
      Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI, Boulder CO, USA) (formerly
      National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC)) and the British Geological Survey
      (BGS, Edinburgh, Scotland).

      The World Magnetic Model is the standard model used by the U.S. Department
      of Defense, the U.K. Ministry of Defence, the North Atlantic Treaty
      Organization (NATO) and the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO),
      for navigation, attitude and heading referencing systems using the
      geomagnetic field. It is also used widely in civilian navigation and
      heading systems. The model, associated software, and documentation are
      distributed by NCEI on behalf of NGA. The model is produced at 5-year
      intervals, with the current model expiring on December 31, 2024.

      Changes of the fluid flow in the Earth's outer core lead to unpredictable
      changes in the Earth's magnetic field. Fortunately, the system has large
      inertia, so that these changes take place over time scales of many
      years. By surveying the field for a few years, one can precisely map the
      present field and its rate of change and then linearly extrapolate it out
      into the future. Provided that suitable satellite magnetic observations
      are available, the prediction of the WMM is highly accurate on its release
      date and then subsequently deteriorates towards the end of the 5 year
      epoch, when it has to be updated with revised values of the model
      coefficients.

      It is important to recognize that the WMM and the charts produced from
      this model characterize only the long-wavelength portion of the Earth's
      internal magnetic field, which is primarily generated in the Earth's fluid
      outer core. The portions of the geomagnetic field generated by the Earth's
      crust and upper mantle, and by the ionosphere and magnetosphere, are
      largely unrepresented in the WMM. Consequently, a magnetic sensor such as
      a compass or magnetometer may observe spatial and temporal magnetic
      anomalies when referenced to the WMM. In particular, certain local,
      regional, and temporal magnetic declination anomalies can exceed 10
      degrees. Anomalies of this magnitude are not common but they do
      exist. Declination anomalies of the order of 3 or 4 degrees are not
      uncommon but are usually of small spatial extent.

      GitHub data description (creator: jasonebox):
      For PROMICE, I use a 2017-2018 average of station GPS data. I added an
      updated position for THU-U2. An improvement would be to have the .kml add
      the position date to the description and how it was obtained. For GC-Net,
      I use a table from Konrad Steffen. I added an updated position for PET
      ELA from 2016.

      Accuracy of positions is very important to avoid arriving in the field at
      an old location. In no cases, do I transcribe positions by hand as that
      can cause expensive problems not finding stations because of bad
      coordinates.

    abstract: >-
       These are historical surface mass balance measurements from Greenland Ice
       Sheet ablation area and surrounding local glaciers. There are
       approximately 3000 unique measurements from 46 sites. The earliest
       measurements are from 1892. Each measurement is accompanied with position
       and date information, as well as quality and source flags.

    title: "Rapid expansion of Greenland’s low-permeability ice slabs"
    abstract: >-
      In recent decades, meltwater runoff has accelerated to become the
      dominant mechanism for mass loss in the Greenland ice sheet. In
      Greenland’s high-elevation interior, porous snow and firn accumulate;
      these can absorb surface meltwater and inhibit runoff, but this buffering
      effect is limited if enough water refreezes near the surface to restrict
      percolation. However, the influence of refreezing on runoff from
      Greenland remains largely unquantified. Here we use firn cores, radar
      observations and regional climate models to show that recent increases in
      meltwater have resulted in the formation of metres-thick,
      low-permeability ‘ice slabs’ that have expanded the Greenland ice sheet’s
      total runoff area by 26 ± 3 per cent since 2001. Although runoff from the
      top of ice slabs has added less than one millimetre to global sea-level
      rise so far, this contribution will grow substantially as ice slabs
      expand inland in a warming climate. Runoff over ice slabs is set to
      contribute 7 to 33 millimetres and 17 to 74 millimetres to global
      sea-level rise by 2100 under moderate- and high-emissions scenarios,
      respectively—approximately double the estimated runoff from Greenland’s
      high-elevation interior, as predicted by surface mass balance models
      without ice slabs. Ice slabs will have an important role in enhancing
      surface meltwater feedback processes, fundamentally altering the ice
      sheet’s present and future hydrology.
