The map was created using the Northern and Mid Latitude Soil Database. The map is in ESRI Shapefile format, consisting of 11 regional areas.. Polygons have attributes that give the percentage polygon area that is a given soil type. The map shows the dominant soil of the spatial polygon unless the polygon is over 90 percent rock or ice. It also shows the proportion of polygon encompassed by the dominant soil or nonsoil. Soils include turbels, orthels, histels, histosols, mollisols, vertisols, aridisols, andisols, entisols, spodosols, inceptisols (and hapludolls), alfisols (cryalf and udalf), natric great groups, aqu-suborders, glaciers, and rocklands.

    abstract: 'The Sea Ice Index provides a quick look at Arctic- and Antarctic-wide changes in sea ice. It is a source for consistent, up-to-date sea ice extent and concentration images, in PNG format, and data values, in GeoTIFF and ASCII text files, from November 1978 to the present. Sea Ice Index images also depict trends and anomalies in ice cover calculated using a 30-year reference period of 1981 through 2010.

The images and data are produced in a consistent way that makes the Index time-series appropriate for use when looking at long-term trends in sea ice cover. Both monthly and daily products are available. However, monthly products are better to use for long-term trend analysis because errors in the daily product tend to be averaged out in the monthly product and because day-to-day variations are often the result of short-term weather.'

        Murres are among the most abundant seabirds in the Northern Hemisphere with a

        identified but the majority of regional populations have shown declines over the
        past three decades. While they are currently abundant, climate change is
        projected to pose problems to murres in the future, especially for the more
        northern species, the thick-billed murre, which is strongly associated with sea
        ice. Other threats include fisheries interactions, over-exploitation,
        contaminants, and oil spills, the latter becoming more important if climate
        change expands shipping and hydrocarbon development in the Arctic.

        Greenland Ecosystem Monitoring (GEM) is an integrated monitoring and

        and feedbacks in the Arctic. Since 1995 the programme has established a
        coherent and integrated understanding of the functioning of ecosystems
        in a highly variable climate, which is based upon a comprehensive,
        long-term inter-disciplinary data collection carried out by Danish and
        Greenlandic monitoring and research institutions. 

        The GEM Programme put around 75 scientists in the field annually to
        collect data on ecosystem and climate change in Greenland. The data
        base currently covers data from monitoring programmes from Zackenberg
        (1995-), Kobbefjord at Nuuk (2007-) and Disko (2017-). The well over
        1000 parameters are freely available via the GEM Database and used by
        GEM participants and external scientists to produce scientific papers,
        scientific assessments, advisory reports, etc.

    title: 'Geothermal heat flux distribution for the Greenland ice sheet, derived by combining a global representation andinformation from deep ice cores'
    abstract: >-
      We present a distribution of the geothermal heat flux (GHF) for
      Greenland, which is an update of two earlier versions by Greve (2005,
      Ann. Glaciol. 42) and Greve and Herzfeld (2013, Ann. Glaciol. 54). The
      GHF distribution is constructed in two steps. First, the global
      representation by Pollack et al. (1993, Rev. Geophys. 31) is scaled for
      the area of Greenland. Second, by means of a paleoclimatic simulation
      carried out with the ice sheet model SICOPOLIS, the GHF values for five
      deep ice core locations are modified such that observed and simulated
      basal temperatures match closely. The resulting GHF distribution
      generally features low values in the south and the north-west, whereas
      elevated values prevail in central North Greenland and towards the
      north-east. The data are provided as NetCDF files on two different grids
      (EPSG:3413 grid, Bamber grid) that have frequently been used in modelling
      studies of the Greenland ice sheet, and for the three different
      resolutions of 5 km, 10 km and 20 km.

    title: 'Sentinel-2 Imagery Mosaics'
    abstract: >-
        Each summer, surface melting of the margin of the Greenland Ice Sheet
        exposes a distinctive visible stratigraphy that is related to past
        variability in subaerial dust deposition across the accumulation zone
        and subsequent ice flow toward the margin. Here we map this surface
        stratigraphy along the northern margin of the ice sheet using mosaicked
        Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite imagery from the end of the 2019 melt
        season and finer-resolution WorldView-2/3 imagery for smaller regions of
        interest. We trace three distinct transitions in apparent dust
        concentration and the top of a darker basal layer. The three dust
        transitions have been identified previously as representing
        late-Pleistocene climatic transitions, allowing us to develop a coarse
        margin chronostratigraphy for northern Greenland. Substantial folding of
        late-Pleistocene stratigraphy is observed but uncommon. The oldest
        conformal surface-exposed ice in northern Greenland is likely located
        adjacent to Warming Land and may be up to ~55 thousand years old. Basal
        ice is commonly exposed hundreds of metres from the ice margin and may
        indicate a widespread frozen basal thermal state. We conclude that the
        ice margin across northern Greenland offers multiple opportunities to
        recover paleoclimatically distinct ice relative to previously studied
        regions in southwestern Greenland.

        Countries distinguish between metropolitan (homeland) and independent
        and semi-independent portions of sovereign states. If you want to see
        the dependent overseas regions broken out (like in ISO codes, see France
        for example), use map units instead.

        Each country is coded with a world region that roughly follows the
        United Nations setup.

        Countries are coded with standard ISO and FIPS codes. French INSEE codes
        are also included.

        Includes some thematic data from the United Nations (1), U.S. Central
        Intelligence Agency, and elsewhere.

    abstract: >-
        This atlas consists of a description of data analysis procedures and
        horizontal maps of climatological distribution fields of temperature at
        selected standard depth levels of the World Ocean on one-degree and
        quarter-degree latitude-longitude grids.  The aim of the maps is to
        illustrate large-scale characteristics of the distribution of ocean
        temperature.  The fields used to generate these climatological maps were
        computed by objective analysis of all scientifically quality-controlled
        historical temperature data in the World Ocean Database 2018.  Maps are
        presented for climatological composite periods (annual, seasonal,
        monthly, seasonal and monthly difference fields from the annual mean
        field, and the number of observations) at 102 standard depths.

        Contribution of the Greenland Ice Sheet to sea-level over the next
        millennium using Large Ensemble Simulations, spatial time series,
        2008-3007.
    abstract: >-
        The Greenland Ice Sheet holds around 7.2 meters of sea-level equivalent. In
        recent decades rising atmosphere and ocean temperatures have led to an
        acceleration in mass loss, adding an average of about 0.5 millimeters per
        year to global mean sea-level between 1991 and 2015. Current ice margin
        recession in Greenland is led by the retreat of outlet glaciers, the large
        rivers of ice ending in narrow fjords that drain the ice sheet
        interior. Recent progress in measuring ice thickness is enabling models to
        reproduce the complex flow patterns found in outlet glaciers, a key step
        towards realistic projections. Here we pair an outlet glacier resolving ice
        sheet model with a comprehensive uncertainty quantification to estimate
        Greenland's contribution to sea-level over the next millennium under
        different climate forcings. We find that Greenland could contribute 5-33
        centimeters to sea-level by 2100 and 11-155 centimeters by 2200, with
        discharge from outlet glaciers contributing 6-45% of the total mass
        loss. Our analysis shows that uncertainties in projecting mass loss are
        dominated by uncertainties in climate scenarios and surface processes,
        followed by ice dynamics, whereas uncertainties in ocean conditions play a
        minor role, particularly in the long term. We project that Greenland will
        very likely become ice-free within a millennium without significant
        reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.

        This dataset compilation contains the simulations for the manuscript
        "Contribution of the Greenland Ice Sheet to sea-level over the next
        millennium" prepared with the Parallel Ice Sheet Model (PISM).

        This dataset provides the likelihood of a pixel being ice covered at the
        year 3007 for the RCPs (Representative Concentration Pathways) 2.6, 4.5, and
        8.5 for LES (Large Ensemble Simulations).

      The product provides modeled mean annual ground temperatures (MAGT) at the
      top of the permafrost for the Northern Hemisphere at 1 km spatial
      resolution. Permafrost probability (fraction values from 0 to 1) is
      assigned to each grid cell with MAGT < 0°C. Based on its permafrost
      probability each grid cell is classified as continuous, discontinuous and
      sporadic permafrost. The processing extent covers exposed land areas of
      the Northern Hemisphere down to 25 ° latitude. The mean MAGT was validated
      with GTN-P and TSP borehole ground temperature data and yielded a RMS of
      2.0 °C. According to the results, permafrost (MAGT < 0 °C) covers 15 % of
      exposed land of the Northern Hemisphere.

      The map was produced within the project ESA Data User Element
      GlobPermafrost.

      A coastline of Kalaallit Nunaat/ Greenland covering all land and islands,
      produced in 2017 for the BAS map 'Greenland and the European Arctic'. The
      dataset was produced by extracting the land mask from the Greenland
      BedMachine dataset and manually editing anomalous data. Some missing
      islands were added and glacier fronts were updated using 2017 satellite
      imagery. The dataset can be used for cartography, analysis and as a mask,
      amongst other uses. At very large scales, the data will appear angular due
      to the nature of being extracted from a raster with 150 m cell size, but
      the dataset should be suitable for use at most scales and can be edited by
      the user to exclude very small islands if required. The projection of the
      dataset is WGS 84 NSIDC Sea Ice Polar Stereographic North, EPSG 3413. The
      dataset does not promise to cover every island and coastlines were
      digitised using the data creator's interpretation of the landforms from
      the images.

    title: 'Global Land Ice Measurements from Space glacier database'
    abstract: >-
      Global Land Ice Measurements from Space (GLIMS) is an international
      initiative with the goal of repeatedly surveying the world's estimated
      200,000 glaciers. GLIMS uses data collected by the Advanced Spaceborne
      Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) instrument aboard the
      Terra satellite and the LANDSAT series of satellites, along with
      historical observations.

      The GLIMS initiative has created a unique glacier inventory, storing
      information about the extent and rates of change of all the world's
      mountain glaciers and ice caps. The GLIMS Glacier Database was built up
      from data contributions from many glaciological institutions, which are
      managed by Regional Coordinators, who coordinate the production of glacier
      mapping results for their particular region. The GLIMS Glacier Database
      provides students, educators, scientists, and the public with reliable
      glacier data from these analyses. New glacier data are continually being
      added to the database.

    title: 'The World Magnetic Model'
    abstract: >-
      The World Magnetic Model is a joint product of the United States’ National
      Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) and the United Kingdom’s Defence
      Geographic Centre (DGC). The WMM was developed jointly by the National
      Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI, Boulder CO, USA) (formerly
      National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC)) and the British Geological Survey
      (BGS, Edinburgh, Scotland).

      The World Magnetic Model is the standard model used by the U.S. Department
      of Defense, the U.K. Ministry of Defence, the North Atlantic Treaty
      Organization (NATO) and the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO),
      for navigation, attitude and heading referencing systems using the
      geomagnetic field. It is also used widely in civilian navigation and
      heading systems. The model, associated software, and documentation are
      distributed by NCEI on behalf of NGA. The model is produced at 5-year
      intervals, with the current model expiring on December 31, 2024.

      Changes of the fluid flow in the Earth's outer core lead to unpredictable
      changes in the Earth's magnetic field. Fortunately, the system has large
      inertia, so that these changes take place over time scales of many
      years. By surveying the field for a few years, one can precisely map the
      present field and its rate of change and then linearly extrapolate it out
      into the future. Provided that suitable satellite magnetic observations
      are available, the prediction of the WMM is highly accurate on its release
      date and then subsequently deteriorates towards the end of the 5 year
      epoch, when it has to be updated with revised values of the model
      coefficients.

      It is important to recognize that the WMM and the charts produced from
      this model characterize only the long-wavelength portion of the Earth's
      internal magnetic field, which is primarily generated in the Earth's fluid
      outer core. The portions of the geomagnetic field generated by the Earth's
      crust and upper mantle, and by the ionosphere and magnetosphere, are
      largely unrepresented in the WMM. Consequently, a magnetic sensor such as
      a compass or magnetometer may observe spatial and temporal magnetic
      anomalies when referenced to the WMM. In particular, certain local,
      regional, and temporal magnetic declination anomalies can exceed 10
      degrees. Anomalies of this magnitude are not common but they do
      exist. Declination anomalies of the order of 3 or 4 degrees are not
      uncommon but are usually of small spatial extent.
