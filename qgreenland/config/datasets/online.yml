    title: 'Sentinel-2 Imagery Mosaics'
    abstract: >-
        Abstract for reference publication: Each summer, surface melting of the
        margin of the Greenland Ice Sheet exposes a distinctive visible
        stratigraphy that is related to past variability in subaerial dust
        deposition across the accumulation zone and subsequent ice flow toward
        the margin. Here we map this surface stratigraphy along the northern
        margin of the ice sheet using mosaicked Sentinel-2 multispectral
        satellite imagery from the end of the 2019 melt season and
        finer-resolution WorldView-2/3 imagery for smaller regions of interest.
        We trace three distinct transitions in apparent dust concentration and
        the top of a darker basal layer. The three dust transitions have been
        identified previously as representing late-Pleistocene climatic
        transitions, allowing us to develop a coarse margin chronostratigraphy
        for northern Greenland. Substantial folding of late-Pleistocene
        stratigraphy is observed but uncommon. The oldest conformal
        surface-exposed ice in northern Greenland is likely located adjacent to
        Warming Land and may be up to ~55 thousand years old. Basal ice is
        commonly exposed hundreds of metres from the ice margin and may
        indicate a widespread frozen basal thermal state. We conclude that the
        ice margin across northern Greenland offers multiple opportunities to
        recover paleoclimatically distinct ice relative to previously studied
        regions in southwestern Greenland.
