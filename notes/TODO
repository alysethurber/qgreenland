* Make FetchData task generic (url as parameter):
  * Consider having the top-level task for each project read YAML and pass dict
    up to every parent task, so every task would take a single dict param and
    extract what that task needs.

* Merge functionality of qgis and luigi in to one container and conda env:
  * Run qgis with `docker exec luigi qgis ...`? How to forward X?

* Puppetry
  * Mount: `/share/appdata/qgreenland` (See: https://nsidc.org/jira/browse/SAS-13855)

* Code quality checks:
  * Lint:
    * flake8-bugbear
    * flake8-debugger
    * flake8-string-format
    * flake8-comprehensions

* Automated code quality checks:
  * Lint
  * Test

* Bumpversion integration

* QGreenland as a package
  * How do we tell Luigi to use a package instead of module?
