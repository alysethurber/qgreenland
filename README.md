# QGreenland

www.qgreenland.org


## A Free GIS Package for Greenland

QGreenland is a free mapping tool to support interdisciplinary
Greenland-focused research, teaching, decision making, and collaboration.

Combines key datasets into a unified, all-in-one GIS analysis and visualization
environment for offline and online use.

An international Editorial Board and Project Collaborators connects the
QGreenland Team to data and user communities.


## Disclaimer

QGreenland should not be used as a sole navigational aid while performing remote
research activities in Greenland. Always bring appropriate saftey and
navigational aids (including hard-copies of topographic maps) when visiting the
field.

QGreenland's layers contain errors from the original data providers which
cannot be corrected without making assumptions, so we've chosen to leave many
of those errors in. You will find layers whose georeferencing differs in
various areas of the map. Please use the 'Greenland Coastlines' layer as the
reference for geolocating Greenland's coastline.


# Getting Started

We recommend using QGIS 3.10.x, as it is the Long Term Support version as of
this writing. You can find downloads and instructions
[here](https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html).

After installing QGIS, [download QGreenland](http://www.qgreenland.org/explore) and
unzip it with your unzip tool of choice if you haven not already done so.
Finally, open the `qgreenland.qgs` file contained inside with QGIS.


## What's Inside?

At the root of the package, you will find scientific discipline-specific
directories containing data. Additionally, the following files are present at
the package root:

* `qgreenland.pdf` (COMING SOON): Detailed user-guide.
* `README.txt`: The README file you are currently reading.
* `CHANGELOG.txt`: A summary of changes for each new QGreenland version.
* `CONTRIBUTING.txt`: Instructions to users looking for help contributing to
  this project.
* `STYLE.txt`: Guidelines and standards for QGreenland styling.
* `manifest.csv`: Comma-separated values representing the configuration of
  layers in QGreenland.

# Contributing

Please see [contributing instructions](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more info. A good
portion of this document contains technical instructions about running the
QGreenland pipeline, but also includes less-technical instructions for
contributing styles you have developed within QGIS. Our goal is to make it as
easy as possible for any user of QGreenland to contribute to the project, so
please do not be deterred from sharing your ideas.
