# What is QGreenland?

![Qgreenland examples](_images/qgreenland-examples.jpg)

QGreenland is a free and open-source Greenland-focused GIS environment for data
analysis and viewing, powered by [QGIS](https://qgis.org>). QGreenland is
delivered in two ways:

1. as a large Zip package containing a core set of data curated to serve the
   majority of users; and

2. as a QGIS plugin for downloading a custom set of data, including data which
   isn't part of the Zip package (for example, due to filesize constraints).


## What QGreenland *is not*

* The QGreenland project is not a data-production project. While we do
  process existing data, it is only to enable efficient and effective viewing
  in the QGreenland QGIS environment.

* QGreenland is not a navigational aid.
