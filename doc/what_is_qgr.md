# What is QGreenland?

![QGreenland examples](_images/qgreenland-examples.jpg)

QGreenland is a free and open-source Greenland-focused GIS environment for data
analysis and viewing, powered by [QGIS](https://qgis.org). QGreenland is
delivered in two ways:

1. **QGreenland Core**: a large Zip package containing a core set of data
   curated to serve the majority of users. This documentation page is about
   QGreenland Core.

2. **QGreenland Custom (beta)**: a QGIS plugin for downloading a custom set of
   data, including data which is not part of the QGreenland Core zip package
   (for example, due to filesize constraints). QGreenland Custom has its own
   [documentation](https://qgreenland-plugin.readthedocs.io).


## What QGreenland *is not*

* The QGreenland project is not a data-production project. While we do
  process existing data, it is only to enable efficient and effective viewing
  in the QGreenland QGIS environment.

* QGreenland is not a navigational aid.
