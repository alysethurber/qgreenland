# Create a layout for print or publication

Once youâ€™ve created a map in the QGIS map display that you would like to print
or publish, you need to switch to the QGIS print layout. Select "Print Layout"
from the "Project" menu.

```{note}
The **Project Toolbar** ![project_toolbar](/_images/project_toolbar.jpg) also
contains a button (![print_layout_button](/_images/print_layout_button.jpg))
that creates a new **Print Layout**.
```

First, name your new print layout after the figure you plan to create and click
"OK".

![print_layout_name](/_images/print_layout_name.jpg)

When the print layout window opens, it will be initially blank.

![blank_print_layout](/_images/blank_print_layout.jpg)

To change the size and orientation of your print layout, right click in the map
area and choose "Page Properties". This will add page size options to the **Item
Properties** panel on the right side of the screen.

The print layout will allow you to add features to your map such as a title,
legend, north arrow, scale bar, pictures, etc by interacting with the buttons in
the Toolbar on the left of the screen.

To add a map to your layout, click on the **Add Map** button
![print_add_map](/_images/print_add_map.jpg). Click and drag to create a box
where the map will appear on the print layout display.

![map_layout_with_map](/_images/map_layout_with_map.jpg)

To zoom into the region shown in the map or change the extent, click on the
**Move Item Content** button
![move_item_content](/_images/move_item_content.jpg), which will make it
possible to manipulate the map area within the box.

Now explore some of the other buttons included in the map layout Toolbar. Add a
north arrow and scale bar. Finally, once one is happy with the layout, try
exporting the layout as an image by opening the "Layout" menu and selecting
"Export as Image".
