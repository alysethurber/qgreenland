# Create a layout for print or publication

Once youâ€™ve created a map in the QGIS map display that you would like to print
or publish, you need to switch to the QGIS print layout. Select "Print Layout"
in the "Project" menu.

```{note}
The **Project Toolbar** ![project_toolbar](/_images/project_toolbar.jpg) also
contains a button (![print_layout_button](/_images/print_layout_button.jpg))
that creates a new **Print Layout**.
```

First, name your new print layout after the figure you plan to create and click
"OK".

![print_layout_name](/_images/print_layout_name.jpg)

When the print layout window opens, it will be initially blank.

To change the size and orientation of your print layout, right click in the map
area and choose "Page Properties". This will add page size options to the **Item
Properties** panel on the right side of the screen.

The print layout will allow you to add features to your map such as a title,
legend, north arrow, scale bar, pictures, etc by interacting with the buttons in
the Toolbar on the left of the screen. To add a map to your layout, click on the
Add Map button ![print_add_map](/_images/print_add_map.jpg).Click and drag to
create a box where the map will appear on the print layout display.
