# Get started with QGreenland

By completing this tutorial, the user will install QGIS, download and open the
QGreenland data package, become familiar with the QGIS interface, and browse
some data included in QGreenland.

## 1) Download and Install QGIS

Go to [qgis.org](https://qgis.org) and download the free QGIS software,
available on Windows, macOS, Linux and Android. It is recommended to download
the long term release (3.16 or later) version.

## 2) Download and open the QGreenland package

Download the QGreenland data package (v2.0.0) at
[https://qgreenland.org/download](https://qgreenland.org/download).

Save the zip package to a location of your choice and unzip it. Open the
`qgreenland.qgz` file in the data package folder by double-clicking it. QGIS
will open automatically and display the QGreenland data environment.


```{note}
If QGIS is already open, one can open the `qgreenland.qgz` project file
within QGIS by navigating to the "Project >Open..." option in the menu bar and
selecting the `qgreenland.qgz` file from its saved location.
```

## 3) Get to know the QGIS Interface

The main components of the QGIS interface are the Menu Bar, toolbars, panels,
Map View, and Status Bar

The Menu Bar and toolbars are different ways to access most QGIS functions, such
as opening or saving a project or analyzing the data using geoprocessing
tools. Panels are another way for users to interact with data layers and
functions in QGIS.

The Layers panel is where all data layers in the current project are
listed. Layers can be toggled on or off, which will control whether or not they
show up in the map view. Layers are listed in the order in which they show up in
the map view - layers at the top of the list show up on top in the map view, and
vice versa. Layers can be manually moved around in the layers panel to change
the order in which they show up. Panels and toolbars can also be manually moved
around the QGIS interface to fit the userâ€™s preferences.

Lastly, the Status Bar is the bar at the bottom of the QGIS window that shows
the current coordinate reference system of the map view, any available plugin
updates, and the map view scale. Also included in the Status Bar is a quick
search bar and a button to open a Log Messages window to view log messages.

core features:
