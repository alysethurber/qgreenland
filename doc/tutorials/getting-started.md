# Get started with QGreenland

By completing this tutorial, the user will install QGIS, download and open the
QGreenland data package, become familiar with the QGIS interface, and browsing
some data included in QGreenland.

## 1) Download and Install QGIS

Go to [qgis.org](https://qgis.org) and download the free QGIS software,
available on Windows, macOS, Linux and Android. It is recommended you download
the long term release (3.16 or later) version.

## 2) Download and open the QGreenland package

Download the QGreenland data package (v2.0.0) at
[https://qgreenland.org/download](https://qgreenland.org/download).

Save the zip package to a location of your choice and unzip it. Open the
`qgreenland.qgz` file in the data package folder by double-clicking it. QGIS
will open automatically and display the QGreenland data environment.


```{note}
You can also open QGIS first and then open the `qgreenland.qgz` project file
within QGIS by navigating to the "Project >Open..." option in the menu bar and
selecting the `qgreenland.qgz` file from its saved location.
