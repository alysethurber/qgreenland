# Calculate the volume of the Greenland ice sheet

The **Processing Toolbox** in QGIS provides a collection of tools and
pre-written algorithms that allow the user to perform a wide variety of raster
and vector data analyses. See the [QGIS
manual](https://docs.qgis.org/3.16/en/docs/user_manual/processing/toolbox.html)
for complete documentation on the **Processing Toolbox**.

In this tutorial, the user will utilize the **Processing Toolbox** with data in
QGreenland to calculate the Greenland ice sheet's volume. In doing so, the user
will become familiar with the how to use the **Processing Toolbox** to perform
geospatial analysis.


```{warning}
This tutorial assumes the user has a basic understanding of GIS and geospatial
data models (e.g., the difference between raster and vector data). If one if new
to GIS, it is reccomended to review QGIS' [Gentle Introduction to
GIS](https://docs.qgis.org/3.16/en/docs/gentle_gis_introduction/index.html)
first
```

## Open the Processing Toolbox

The **Processing Toolbox** can be opened from the menu bar by selecting
"View>Panels>Processing Toolbox". This will open a new panel with a variety of
processing tools organized into groups.

The **Processing Toolbox** can also be opened by clicking on the gear
![processing-icon](/_images/processing-icon.jpg) icon in the **Attributes
toolbar** ![attributes-toolbar](/_images/attributes-toolbar.jpg).
