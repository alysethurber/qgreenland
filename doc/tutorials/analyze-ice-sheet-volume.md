# Calculate the volume of the Greenland ice sheet

The **Processing Toolbox** in QGIS provides a collection of tools and
pre-written algorithms that allow the user to perform a wide variety of raster
and vector data analyses. See the [QGIS
manual](https://docs.qgis.org/3.16/en/docs/user_manual/processing/toolbox.html)
for complete documentation on the **Processing Toolbox**.

In this tutorial, the user will utilize the **Processing Toolbox** with data in
QGreenland to calculate the Greenland ice sheet's volume. In doing so, the user
will become familiar with the how to use the **Processing Toolbox** to perform
geospatial analysis.

## 1) Open the Processing Toolbox

The **Processing Toolbox** can be opened from the menu bar by selecting
"View>Panels>Processing Toolbox". This will open a new panel with a variety of
processing tools organized into groups.
