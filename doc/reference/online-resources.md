# Online layers reference

QGreenland can be enriched with layers provided by online services such as [Web
Map Service (WMS)](https://www.ogc.org/standards/wms), [Web Feature Service
(WFS)](https://www.ogc.org/standards/wfs), and [Web Coverage Service
(WCS)](https://www.ogc.org/standards/wcs). This document provides a list of
potentially useful resources that QGIS can connect to to provide layers via the
internet.

See the [How to add an online layer to QGIS](/user-how-to/online-layers.md) page
for information on how to utilize these resources.

* [The National Snow and Ice Data Center
  (NSIDC)](https://nsidc.org/map-services/geospatial-map-services) provides WMS,
  WFS, and WCS for a wide variety of layers.

* The [Arctic Observing Viewer](https://arcticobservingviewer.org/web-services/)
  provides WMS and WFS for observing sites associated with long-term monitoring
  activities in the circumarctic.
  
* The [Arctic Research Mapping Application](https://armap.org/web-services/)
  provides WMS and WFS services for a variety of reference layers.
