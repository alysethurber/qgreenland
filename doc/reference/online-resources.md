# Online layers reference

QGreenland can be enriched with layers provided by online services such as [Web
Map Service (WMS)](https://www.ogc.org/standards/wms), [Web Feature Service
(WFS)](https://www.ogc.org/standards/wfs), and [Web Coverage Service
(WCS)](https://www.ogc.org/standards/wcs). This document provides a list of
potentially useful resources that QGIS can connect to to provide layers via the
internet.

See the [How to add an online layer to QGIS](/user-how-to/online-layers.md) page
for information on how to utilize these resources.

* [The National Snow and Ice Data Center
  (NSIDC)](https://nsidc.org/map-services/geospatial-map-services) [WMS, WFS,
  WCS] provides access to a wide variety of datasets.

* The [Arctic Observing Viewer](https://arcticobservingviewer.org/web-services/)
  [WMS, WFS] provides observing sites associated with long-term monitoring
  activities in the circumarctic.
  
* The [Arctic Research Mapping Application](https://armap.org/web-services/)
  [WMS, WFS] provides a variety of reference layers such as Arctic cities and an
  Arctic base map.

* The [Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland
  (GEUS)](http://maps.greenmin.gl/geusmap/ows/help/?mapname=greenland_portal)
  [WMS, WFS] provides various layers including a geological occurrence map. Note
  that GEUS requests that users of its services provide an email address as part
  of each request. Results may be limited during peak service hours.
