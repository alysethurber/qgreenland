Someone who uses QGreenland in QGIS.


## Boundary

Instead of extent, which to some may imply rectangular or lon/lat-based shape,
use the term "Boundary".

You can define as many boundaries as you want with arbitrary names, in addition
to the required `data` boundary, which is used for defining the initial extent
shown when opening QGIS.
