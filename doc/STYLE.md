TODO: Standards for colors. What do they mean?


## Polygon

Example: "Arctic Protected Areas (CAFF 2017)" for an example.

Protected area polygons will use a "Line pattern fill" with rotation of 45Â° to
produce a "hashed" pattern. Lines will be solid, thickness will be 0.3mm,
spacing will be 2mm. Border and lines will be the same color.

Labels displayed over the hashed polygon will have a buffer of at least 2mm with 100% opacity.
