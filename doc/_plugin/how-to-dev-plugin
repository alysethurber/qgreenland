```
git clone https://github.com/faunalia/qgreenland-plugin.git
```

Use QGIS GUI to locate plugin directory by going to
Settings -> User Profiles -> Open Active Profile Folder.
Then, navigate to the /python/plugins directories.
PWD and copy the full filpath. 

Next symlink the plugin repo to the plugin directory:
```
ln -s $PWD '/filepath'
```

Navigate to plugins -> Installed -> Check box on Qgreenland -> OK

Cnofigure the server by navigating to Web -> Configure the Server -> OK

Instead of needing to shut down QGIS and restart after configuring Qgreenland, 
install the plugin, Plugin Reloader. You can do this by navigating to 
Plugin -> Manage and Install Plugins, then searching for Plugin Reloader in the
search bar. Install the plugin then press OK.

To use the plugin, navigate to Plugin -> Configure -> Qgreenland.
Uncheck the 'run the commands below before reloading'. Leave the 'display'
option checked, and press OK.

Navigate to Plugin Reloader and choose Reload Plugin: qgreenland-plugin.
You should receive a message notifying you that the plugin has been reloaded.
