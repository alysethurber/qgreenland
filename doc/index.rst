Project Summary
===============

Greenland-focused research, planning, and education crosses disciplinary
boundaries. With QGreenland, a free data-viewing platform, anyone can explore a
wide variety of Greenland-focused data identified by an expert team and
Editorial Board. 

QGreenland is a United States National Science Foundation EarthCube-funded
effort (award #1928393). Project development began in 2019, led by the National
Snow and Ice Data Center, which is a part of the University of Colorado Boulder
Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences. The project is
made possible through the generous efforts of a wide range of collaborators.

The QGreenland Team believes in open and accessible resources. QGreenland is
built using free and open software, with development tools and workflows fully
documented on our Github site. We also believe in FAIR (findable, accessible,
interoperable, reproducible) data and strive to include clear information about
original data sources and complete metadata. To the best of our ability, we aim
to include data that are already free and publicly archived.

As QGreenland development continues, we will be expanding our educational
resources, increasing optional data download options, and working to be as
responsive as possible to user feedback. We look forward to hearing from you.
